# Tom Hanks: From Nomadic Beginnings to America's Most Trusted Voice

Tom Hanks, in conversation with Jay Shetty, offers a profound glimpse into his life, revealing how an unconventional childhood shaped his legendary career. From frequent moves to mastering detachment, Hanks shares how adaptability and a strong sense of self propelled him to become one of Hollywood's most beloved figures. 

## Fluidity and Adaptability: The Upside of a Nomadic Childhood

Growing up, Hanks moved through ten different homes by the time he was ten.

> “My home environment was fluid, in that we moved a lot. By the time I was seven, I had lived in eight different homes. By the time I was ten, I'd lived in ten different homes.” - Tom Hanks

Rather than seeing this as a source of instability, Hanks embraced it, becoming comfortable with change and easily adapting to new environments. He learned to size up a room and integrate himself into new social situations quickly.

## The Best Days Are Ahead

Hanks offers an optimistic outlook on life, suggesting that dwelling on the past is counterproductive. 

> "If you're just looking at the past and saying, man, that was when it was great, I wish we could go back. No! You never want to go back. You always have to understand that our best days are still ahead of us." - Tom Hanks

This philosophy emphasizes the importance of embracing the present and future with hope and anticipation.

## The Delicate Balance of Detachment

Hanks explores the concept of detachment, distinguishing between healthy detachment and isolation. While acknowledging that detachment can help navigate difficult people and situations, he also cautions against the habit of choosing isolation as a default mode. Learning when to engage and when to detach is key to maintaining healthy relationships and a balanced life.

Hanks discusses the "hang" of show business, emphasizing the importance of social interaction, collaboration, and creating a sense of community. He recounts a story about Darlene Love, who said she was just there for the "hang," illustrating the value of connection and camaraderie in the creative process.

Hanks highlights the significance of being present in the moment. He touches upon how his experience traveling to sacred sites in Jerusalem, and simply knowing he was standing where history happened, gave him a sense of awe. His latest film, *Here*, further explores this theme, reminding us that the present moment is all we truly have.
